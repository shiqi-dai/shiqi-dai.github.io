<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a research assistant in <a href="https://github.com/thunlp">THUNLP</a> Lab at Tsinghua University, and am currently looking for a PhD position working on computer vision.

I received my master's degree in Computer Technology from <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Tsinghua University</a> in 2024, advised by Prof.<a href="http://zwang.inflexionlab.org/">Zhi Wang</a> . Previously I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from <a href="https://www.ruc.edu.cn/">Renmin University of China</a> in 2021.

My research interest includes diffusion models and Embodied AI. I have published 2 papers at the international AI conferences including AAAI, ICME.

- We propose a diffusion-based generative model learning from a single example in <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. 
<!-- - Our approach involves two core components: 1.an efficient yet expressive level representation, and 2.a latent denoising network with constrained receptive fields.  -->
- Our model suits a wide range of level structures with fewer artifacts than GAN-based approaches.
